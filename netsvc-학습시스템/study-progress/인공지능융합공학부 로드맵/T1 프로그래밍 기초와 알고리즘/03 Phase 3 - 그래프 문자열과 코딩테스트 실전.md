# T1 Phase 3 — 그래프·문자열과 코딩테스트 실전

> 학부 교과 **코딩테스트기초(2학년 1학기)** 의 뒤 절반

- 목표: 그래프로 모델링되는 문제를 알아보고, 제한 시간 안에 푼다.
- 분량: 약 20시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- "도시와 도로", "작업과 선행 조건" 같은 서술을 그래프로 바꿔 그린다
- BFS·DFS·다익스트라·벨만포드를 문제 조건(가중치 유무, 음수 간선)에 따라 골라 쓴다
- 최소 신장 트리(MST)가 필요한 상황을 알아본다
- 문자열 검색을 O(n+m)에 하는 방법을 안다
- 기술 면접에서 풀이를 **말로 설명하면서** 코드를 쓴다

> **Phase 4와의 관계**: 여기서 배우는 BFS/DFS/다익스트라가 [Phase 4](04%20Phase%204%20-%20인공지능%20알고리즘%20탐색과%20최적화.md)의 A* 탐색으로 그대로 이어진다. 순서를 바꾸지 않는다.
