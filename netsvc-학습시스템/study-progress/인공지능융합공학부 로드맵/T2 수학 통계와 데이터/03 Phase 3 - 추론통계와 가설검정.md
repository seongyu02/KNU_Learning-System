# T2 Phase 3 — 추론통계와 가설검정

> 학부 교과 **데이터사이언스통계(1학년 2학기)** 의 뒤 절반

- 목표: 표본에서 얻은 숫자로 모집단에 대해 말할 때, 그 말이 어디까지 보장되는지 안다.
- 분량: 약 16시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 신뢰구간을 계산하고 **"95% 신뢰구간"이 정확히 무엇을 뜻하는지** 오해 없이 설명한다
- 귀무가설·대립가설을 세우고 상황에 맞는 검정(t검정·비율검정·카이제곱)을 고른다
- p값을 해석하고, **p값이 말해 주지 않는 것**을 안다
- 1종/2종 오류와 검정력의 관계를 설명한다
- 표본 크기가 결과에 미치는 영향을 시뮬레이션으로 보인다

> **왜 이게 AI 트랙에 필요한가**: [T3 Phase 4(기계학습 프로젝트)](../T3%20머신러닝과%20딥러닝/04%20Phase%204%20-%20기계학습%20프로젝트.md)에서 "모델 A가 모델 B보다 정확도 1%p 높다"가 우연인지 아닌지를 판단할 때 그대로 쓰인다. 이 판단을 못 하면 성능 비교표가 근거가 되지 못한다.

## 산출물

Phase 2에서 만든 EDA 보고서의 데이터로 검정 보고서 하나.

1. 데이터를 보기 **전에** 세운 가설 하나 (사후에 만든 가설이 아니어야 한다)
2. 고른 검정 방법과 그것을 고른 이유
3. 신뢰구간과 p값, 그리고 결론 한 문장
4. **"이 결론이 틀릴 수 있는 경로"** 세 가지 — 표본 편향, 다중 비교, 효과 크기 대비 표본 크기
