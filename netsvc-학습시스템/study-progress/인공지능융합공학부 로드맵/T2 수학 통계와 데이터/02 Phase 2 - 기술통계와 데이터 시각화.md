# T2 Phase 2 — 기술통계와 데이터 시각화

> 학부 교과 **데이터사이언스통계(1학년 2학기, 전공기초 3학점)** 의 앞 절반
> ※ 이 과목은 강남대 교과목해설 페이지에 설명이 없다. 범위는 과목명과 후속 과목(회귀분석)의 선이수 관계로 잡았다.

- 목표: 처음 보는 데이터셋을 받아 "무엇이 들어 있고 어디가 이상한가"를 그림과 숫자로 답한다.
- 분량: 약 18시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 변수의 종류(범주형·순서형·연속형)를 구분하고 그에 맞는 그래프를 고른다
- 평균·중앙값·사분위수·표준편차를 계산하고, 분포가 치우쳤을 때 어느 것을 써야 하는지 판단한다
- 두 변수의 관계를 산점도·교차표로 보고 상관계수를 해석한다
- **상관과 인과를 구분해서 말한다**
- 모집단과 표본의 차이, 표본이 편향되는 경로를 설명한다
- matplotlib·seaborn·Plotly로 목적에 맞는 그래프를 만든다

## 산출물

공공데이터 하나를 골라 만드는 EDA 보고서. 반드시 들어가야 하는 것:

1. 각 변수의 종류와 결측·이상치 현황 표
2. 분포 그림 3개 이상 — **각 그림 아래에 "이 그림이 말해 주는 것" 한 문장**
3. 변수 두 쌍의 관계와 상관계수, 그리고 **"이건 인과로 읽으면 안 되는 이유"** 한 문단
4. 이 데이터로 답할 수 있는 질문 / 답할 수 없는 질문 목록
