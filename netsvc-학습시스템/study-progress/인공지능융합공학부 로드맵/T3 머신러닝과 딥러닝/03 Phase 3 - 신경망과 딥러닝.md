# T3 Phase 3 — 신경망과 딥러닝

> 학부 교과 **신경망(2학년 2학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)** · 선이수 = 인공지능수학
> 교과목해설: "퍼셉트론, 다층 신경망, 역전파 알고리즘을 포함한 주요 신경망 모델과 학습 방법에 대해 학습하며, 다양한 실습을 통해 신경망 모델을 구축하고 훈련시키는 방법을 익히게 된다"

- 목표: 신경망을 프레임워크 없이 한 번 직접 만들어, 학습이 안 될 때 **어디를 봐야 하는지** 안다.
- 분량: 약 28시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 퍼셉트론 하나가 하는 계산을 손으로 쓴다
- 순전파·역전파를 계산 그래프로 그리고 NumPy로 구현한다
- 활성화 함수(sigmoid·tanh·ReLU)를 고르는 기준과 기울기 소실 문제를 설명한다
- 가중치 초기화가 왜 중요한지 말한다
- 정규화(L2·드롭아웃)·배치 정규화가 무엇을 고치는지 안다
- 미니배치 경사하강·모멘텀·RMSprop·Adam의 차이를 설명한다
- 하이퍼파라미터 튜닝을 무작정이 아니라 우선순위를 두고 한다

> **선행 확인**: [T2 Phase 4(인공지능 수학)](../T2%20수학%20통계와%20데이터/04%20Phase%204%20-%20인공지능%20수학.md)의 연쇄법칙·기울기를 모르면 3-B(역전파)에서 멈춘다. 강남대 커리큘럼이 인공지능수학을 이 과목의 선이수로 지정한 이유가 정확히 이것이다.

## 산출물

1. **NumPy만으로 만든 2층 신경망** — 순전파·역전파·파라미터 갱신을 직접 짠다. 프레임워크 금지. `lab/` 폴더의 venv를 그대로 쓰면 된다
2. 기울기 검사(gradient check) 통과 기록
3. 같은 문제를 PyTorch나 TensorFlow로 다시 풀고, **직접 만든 것과 결과가 같은지** 확인
4. 학습이 안 되는 상황 3개를 일부러 만들고(학습률 과다 / 초기화 0 / 정규화 없음) 각각의 손실 곡선과 원인 설명
