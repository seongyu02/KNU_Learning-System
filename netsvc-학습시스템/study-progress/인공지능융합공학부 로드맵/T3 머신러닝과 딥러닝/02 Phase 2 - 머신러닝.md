# T3 Phase 2 — 머신러닝

> 학부 교과 **머신러닝(2학년 2학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)** · 선이수 = 회귀분석
> 교과목해설: "지도학습, 비지도학습, 강화학습의 기초를 배우고, 실제 데이터 세트를 사용하여 모델을 훈련하고 평가하는 방법을 실습을 통해 익힌다"

- 목표: 문제를 보고 어떤 학습 방식·어떤 모델로 갈지 고르고, 고른 이유를 성능 지표로 방어한다.
- 분량: 약 39시간 (저장소 24시간 + 강화학습 15시간)
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 지도·비지도·강화학습을 문제 형태로 구분한다 (레이블이 있는가 / 보상이 있는가)
- 분류와 회귀를 구분하고 각각의 평가 지표를 고른다
- 결정트리·랜덤포레스트·SVM·KNN이 각각 어떤 데이터에서 강한지 말한다
- K-means·계층 군집·차원축소(PCA)를 언제 쓰는지 안다
- 훈련/검증/테스트를 나누고 교차검증으로 성능을 추정한다
- 정확도가 높은데 쓸모없는 모델(불균형 데이터)을 알아보고 정밀도·재현율·F1·ROC-AUC로 다시 본다
- 과적합·과소적합을 학습곡선으로 진단한다

> **[T2 Phase 5(회귀분석)](../T2%20수학%20통계와%20데이터/05%20Phase%205%20-%20회귀분석.md)을 먼저 끝낸다.** 강남대 커리큘럼도 회귀분석을 이 과목의 선이수로 지정하고 있고, 실제로 선형회귀를 모르면 이 Phase의 절반이 공중에 뜬다.

## 2-E. 강화학습 — Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning (2026-09-04 확보)

학부 교과목해설이 "지도학습, 비지도학습, **강화학습**의 기초"라고 명시하는데 저장소에 강화학습 자료가 없었다. **2026-09-04에 MOOC 강좌를 수강·정리해 이 공백을 메웠다.**

메인: [Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning](../../../courses/mooc/Data%20Analysis%20and%20Statistics/Fundamentals%20of%20Reinforcement/README.md) (University of Alberta · Amii · 5모듈 15시간 · MOOC Plus 포함)

> ⭐ **Sutton & Barto 교재 2판을 따라가는 공식 강좌**다. 밴딧 → MDP → 가치 함수·벨만 방정식 → 동적 계획법 순으로 **"강화학습 문제가 무엇인가"** 를 세운다.
>
> ⚠️ **경험으로부터 배우는 알고리즘(TD·Q-learning)은 이 강좌에 없다** — 전문과정 Course 2의 몫이다. **학부 "머신러닝" 과목의 강화학습 파트에는 이 첫 강좌 하나면 충분하다.**
>
> ⚠️ 강의 안에서 말하는 **"Week N"은 MOOC 모듈 번호보다 1 작다.**
