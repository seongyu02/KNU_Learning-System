# T3 Phase 4 — 기계학습 프로젝트

> 학부 교과 **기계학습프로젝트(3학년 1학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)** · 선이수 = 머신러닝
> 교과목해설: "기계 학습 이론과 기법을 실제 프로젝트에 적용하여 문제를 해결하고 모델을 개발한다. 데이터 수집, 모델 선택, 성능 평가 및 결과 분석을 포함한 종합적인 학습 경험을 제공한다"

- 목표: 모델 하나를 만드는 것이 아니라 **실험을 관리해 가며 성능을 끌어올리는 과정**을 굴린다.
- 분량: 약 22시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 하나의 평가 지표(single number evaluation metric)를 정하고 그 이유를 말한다
- 훈련/개발/테스트 분포가 어긋났을 때 생기는 증상을 알아본다
- 오류 분석(error analysis)으로 **다음에 무엇을 고칠지** 데이터에 근거해 정한다
- 사람 수준 성능(human-level performance)을 기준으로 편향과 분산 중 어느 쪽을 먼저 칠지 판단한다
- 실험을 MLflow 같은 도구로 기록해 어제의 실험을 오늘 재현한다
- 피처 엔지니어링과 편향 점검을 파이프라인의 한 단계로 넣는다

> 이 Phase가 [T6 Phase 5(캡스톤)](../T6%20기획%20통합%20현장/05%20Phase%205%20-%20캡스톤%20디자인%20AI.md)의 예행연습이다. 여기서 "실험 기록이 남는 습관"을 못 들이면 캡스톤에서 무엇이 성능을 올렸는지 설명하지 못한다.

## 산출물

**실험 기록이 남는 ML 프로젝트 하나.** 모델 성능보다 과정이 평가 대상이다.

1. 문제 정의와 **단일 평가 지표**, 그리고 그것을 고른 이유
2. 최소 10회의 실험 기록 (MLflow 등) — 각 실험의 변경점 한 줄과 결과
3. 오류 분석 표 — 틀린 예측 50건을 분류하고, 가장 큰 덩어리가 무엇인지
4. "다음에 무엇을 하겠는가"를 3-4번의 오류 분석에 근거해 쓴 한 문단
5. 처음 베이스라인과 최종 모델의 성능 차이, 그리고 **그 차이를 만든 것이 무엇이었는지**
