# T5 Phase 3 — 인공지능 앱 개발

> 학부 교과 **인공지능앱개발(2학년 2학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)**
> 교과목해설: "React Native의 기본 개념을 배우고, AI 모델과 서비스를 모바일 앱에 통합하는 방법을 익히게 된다. React Native의 크로스 플랫폼 기능을 활용하여 AI 기반 기능을 구현하고, 모바일 애플리케이션을 설계하는 방법을 다룬다"

- 목표: AI 기능이 붙은 모바일 앱을 만들어 실기기에서 돌린다.
- 분량: 약 22시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

> **중복 안내**: **리액트 네이티브 로드맵**이 같은 강의를 훨씬 넓게 다룬다(8 Phase + 부록 2). 여기는 **학부 한 과목 분량으로 압축한 자체 체크박스**다. 저쪽에서 이미 본 강의는 학습일을 옮겨 적는다. 앱 개발이 주 진로라면 이 Phase 대신 리액트 네이티브 로드맵을 통째로 도는 편이 낫다.
>
> **선행**: [Phase 1](01%20Phase%201%20-%20웹%20개발%20기초와%20자바스크립트.md) 1-E(React). React를 모르면 여기가 두 배로 어렵다.

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- React Native의 코어 컴포넌트로 화면을 만든다
- 리스트·입력·터치·이미지를 다룬다
- React Navigation으로 화면 사이를 이동한다
- 네이티브 기능(카메라·위치·알림)을 붙인다
- 서버 API를 호출해 AI 기능을 앱 안에서 쓴다
- 앱을 빌드해 실기기에 올린다

5. 실기기(또는 에뮬레이터)에서 도는 화면 녹화
