# T5 Phase 4 — 네트워크 서비스

> 학부 교과 **네트워크서비스(3학년 2학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)**
>
> ⚠️ **교과목해설 페이지의 설명이 이 과목과 맞지 않는다.** 강남대 교과목해설(2026-09-04 확인)에는 네트워크 서비스 항목에 *"강화 학습의 이론과 기법을 중점적으로 다룬다. 에이전트가 환경과 상호작용하며 학습하는 과정, 보상 기반의 의사결정, 정책 최적화…"* 라고 적혀 있다. 과목명과 완전히 다른 내용이라 **페이지 편집 오류로 보인다.** 이 Phase는 과목명 그대로 네트워크 서비스로 구성했다. 강화학습은 [T3 Phase 2 2-E](../T3%20머신러닝과%20딥러닝/02%20Phase%202%20-%20머신러닝.md)에 별도로 두었다. **수강 전 학과에 확인할 것.**

- 목표: 내 서비스가 인터넷에서 어떻게 도달되는지 계층별로 말하고, 안 될 때 어디를 볼지 안다.
- 분량: 약 18시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

> **중복 안내**: [네트워크 서비스 로드맵](../../네트워크%20서비스%20로드맵/README.md)이 같은 주제를 10 Phase로 훨씬 깊게 다룬다. 여기는 학부 한 과목 분량의 압축판이다.

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- URL을 친 뒤 응답이 오기까지의 과정을 계층 순서로 말한다
- IP·서브넷·포트를 계산하고 라우팅 테이블을 읽는다
- DNS 조회 과정을 설명하고 레코드 종류를 구분한다
- HTTP 요청/응답의 헤더와 상태 코드를 읽는다
- TLS가 무엇을 보장하고 무엇을 보장하지 않는지 안다
- `ping`·`traceroute`·`nslookup`·`curl`로 문제 위치를 좁힌다

## 산출물

**[Phase 2](02%20Phase%202%20-%20서버%20프로그래밍.md)의 API 서버를 인터넷에 노출시킨 기록.**

1. 도메인 하나에 DNS 레코드를 걸고, `dig`/`nslookup` 결과를 캡처
2. HTTPS 적용 (Let's Encrypt 등) — 인증서 체인을 `openssl s_client`로 확인한 출력
3. 계층별 진단 기록 — 일부러 3가지 장애를 만들고(포트 차단 / DNS 오타 / 인증서 만료) 각각 어떤 명령으로 원인을 좁혔는지
4. 한 페이지 구성도 — 클라이언트에서 서버까지 거치는 요소를 순서대로
