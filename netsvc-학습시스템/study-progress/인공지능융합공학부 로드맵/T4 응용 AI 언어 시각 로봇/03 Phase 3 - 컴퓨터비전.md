# T4 Phase 3 — 컴퓨터비전

> 학부 교과 **컴퓨터비전(3학년 1학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)** · 선이수 = 신경망
> 교과목해설: "이미지와 영상 데이터를 컴퓨터가 인식하고 분석하는 원리를 학습하며, 영상 처리, 객체 인식, 특징 추출, 딥러닝 기반 비전 기술 등의 기초 내용을 다룬다. 또한 이를 기반으로 얼굴 인식, 자율주행, 의료 영상 분석 등 다양한 AI 기반 서비스에 어떻게 활용될 수 있는지 학습한다"

- 목표: 이미지가 숫자 배열이라는 데서 출발해, CNN이 왜 이미지에 잘 맞는지 구조로 설명한다.
- 상태: **저장소 자료로 완주 가능하다 ✅** 딥러닝 기반 비전은 Deep Learning Specialization이, **전통 영상 처리(필터링·특징 추출·OpenCV)는 2026-09-04에 확보한 IBM 강좌**가 덮는다.
- 분량: 약 42시간 (저장소 18시간 + 컴퓨터비전 강좌 24시간)
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 합성곱(convolution)이 이미지에 무엇을 하는지 필터 하나를 손으로 적용해 보인다
- 패딩·스트라이드·풀링이 출력 크기에 미치는 영향을 계산한다
- 완전연결층 대신 CNN을 쓰는 이유를 파라미터 수와 위치 불변성으로 설명한다
- LeNet·AlexNet·VGG·ResNet·Inception의 차이와 각각이 해결한 문제를 말한다
- **잔차 연결(residual)이 왜 깊은 망을 학습 가능하게 하는지** 설명한다
- 전이학습으로 적은 데이터에서 이미지 분류기를 만든다
- 데이터 증강(augmentation)을 상황에 맞게 고른다

## 3-E. 전통 영상 처리 — Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing (2026-09-04 확보)

학부 교과목해설의 "영상 처리, 특징 추출"에 해당하는 고전 영역(가우시안 블러·에지 검출·히스토그램·임계화)이 저장소에 없었다. 딥러닝만으로도 Phase 4까지 갈 수 있지만 **전처리 단계에서 막히는 일이 자주 생긴다.** **2026-09-04에 MOOC 강좌를 수강·정리해 이 공백을 메웠다.**

메인: [Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing](../../../courses/mooc/Computer%20Vision/Introduction%20to%20Computer%20Vision%20and%20Image/README.md) (IBM · 6모듈 24시간 · MOOC Plus 포함)

> ⭐ **Module 2(8시간)가 정확히 이 공백을 메운다** — 히스토그램·강도 변환·임계화·아핀 변환·합성곱·Sobel·중간값 필터.
>
> ⭐ **HOG → CNN의 연결이 이 강좌의 백미다.** Module 3의 HOG가 **사람이 고른 Sobel 커널**을 쓰고, Module 4의 CNN은 **그 커널을 학습한다**고 설명한다.
>
> ⚠️ **Module 4(신경망·CNN)는 요약 수준이다.** 이 Phase의 다른 절에 있는 Deep Learning Specialization이 훨씬 깊다. **중복이므로 시간이 없으면 M1·M2·M3·M5만 봐도 된다.**
>
> ⚠️ **영상은 26개뿐이고 24시간의 대부분이 실습 랩(JupyterLab)이다.** 정리본만 읽으면 개념은 잡히지만 손은 안 익는다. **Faster R-CNN은 랩에만 있고 영상 강의에 없다.**
