# T6 Phase 4 — 인공지능 특론 (윤리와 최신 동향)

> 학부 교과 **인공지능특론 I(4학년 1학기) · 인공지능특론 II(4학년 2학기)**, 각 이론실습병행 3학점
> 교과목해설: "인공지능의 최신 주제와 기술을 심층적으로 다룬다. **인공지능 윤리에 대한 학습과 토론을 진행하며**, 최신 연구 동향과 혁신적인 기술에 대해 공부하고 프로젝트를 수행한다"
>
> ※ 교육과정표에는 인공지능특론 I(4-1)·II(4-2)로 나뉘어 있으나, 교과목해설 페이지에는 **두 학기 모두 "인공지능특론 Ⅰ"로 같은 설명이 실려 있다.** II의 별도 설명은 확인하지 못했다.

- 목표: 내가 만든 서비스가 **누구에게 어떻게 해를 끼칠 수 있는지** 구조적으로 점검한다.
- 분량: 약 23시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 알고리즘 편향이 어디서 들어오는지 데이터·모델·배포 단계별로 짚는다
- 공정성 지표들이 서로 충돌한다는 것을 알고, 무엇을 고를지 판단한다
- 설명 가능한 AI(XAI)가 필요한 상황과 그 한계를 말한다
- LLM 특유의 위협(프롬프트 인젝션·데이터 유출·모델 탈취)을 열거하고 대응을 설계한다
- AI 규제(EU AI Act 등)와 국내 규정의 요구를 개발 요구사항으로 번역한다
- 최신 연구 동향을 스스로 따라가는 경로를 갖는다

## 4-E. 최신 동향을 따라가는 경로 (강의 없음)

교과목해설의 "최신 연구 동향"은 강의로 채울 수 없다. 습관으로 만든다.

- 저장소의 [courses/youtube/AI Engineer](../../../courses/youtube/AI%20Engineer) · [courses/youtube/Andrej Karpathy](../../../courses/youtube/Andrej%20Karpathy) · [courses/youtube/Google Cloud Tech](../../../courses/youtube/Google%20Cloud%20Tech) 폴더에 이미 이런 성격의 노트가 쌓여 있다
- 새 영상·논문을 볼 때 `study` 스킬로 정리본을 남기면 이 폴더가 계속 자란다
- **한 학기에 논문 4편**을 목표로 잡는다. 읽은 뒤 한 페이지 요약 — 문제 / 기존 방법의 한계 / 제안 / 한계

## 산출물

**내 서비스의 위험 평가 보고서.** [Phase 3](03%20Phase%203%20-%20인공지능%20서비스%20개발%20II.md)의 v2를 대상으로 한다.

1. 데이터·모델·배포 단계별 편향 유입 경로 점검표
2. LLM 위협 목록과 각각에 대한 현재 방어 수준 (있음/부분/없음)
3. 프롬프트 인젝션을 **실제로 시도한 기록** — 성공했다면 어떻게 막았는지
4. 개인정보 처리 흐름도 — 어떤 데이터가 어디로 가고 얼마나 남는지
5. "이 서비스를 공개하면 안 되는 조건" 세 가지
