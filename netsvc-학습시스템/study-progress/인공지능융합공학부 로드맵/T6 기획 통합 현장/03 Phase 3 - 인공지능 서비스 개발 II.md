# T6 Phase 3 — 인공지능 서비스 개발 II

> 학부 교과 **인공지능서비스개발 II(3학년 2학기, 이론실습병행 3학점)** · 선이수 = 인공지능서비스개발 I
> 교과목해설: "AI 기술의 심화 활용, 대규모 서비스의 설계, 구현 및 운영 방법에 대해 배우며, 프로젝트형 수업을 통해 복잡한 AI 서비스 시스템을 개발하고 관리하는 경험을 쌓게 된다"

- 목표: v1을 **에이전트가 도는 v2**로 키우고, 운영 지표로 상태를 본다.
- 분량: 약 30시간
- 마지막 학습일: (미학습)

## 이 단계가 끝나면 할 수 있어야 하는 것

- 에이전트가 도구(tool)를 호출하는 구조를 설계한다
- 여러 에이전트로 나눌 때의 이득과 비용을 판단한다
- MCP로 외부 시스템을 에이전트에 연결한다
- 사람이 개입해야 하는 지점(human in the loop)을 설계한다
- 세션·메모리를 관리한다
- LLM 서비스의 관측(observability)과 추적(tracing)을 붙인다
- "느낌"이 아니라 지표로 품질을 평가한다

## 산출물

**v2 — 에이전트가 도는 서비스와 운영 대시보드.**

1. 에이전트 하나 이상이 도구를 호출해 작업을 완수 — 도구 목록과 각각의 실패 처리
2. 사람 개입 지점 최소 하나 — 어떤 조건에서 사람에게 넘기는지 명시
3. 추적(tracing) — 요청 하나가 어떤 단계를 거쳤는지 볼 수 있는 화면이나 로그
4. 평가표 — 20개 시나리오에 대한 성공/실패와 실패 원인 분류
5. 비용 기록 — 요청 1건당 토큰과 비용
